# Launchpage
An aesthetic app launcher for the new tab page

## Overview
Launchpage is a replacement for Chrome's built-in New Tab Page. It displays your apps in a grid, but it also allows you to set a wallpaper and add webpages as icons. The color scheme adapts to match the wallpaper you choose.

Launchpage follows the principles of [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) for consistency with Google's other products.

## Install
You can install Launchpage directly from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/launchpage/bkdpdcgcbkkohcelcibdenakcngkmamg).
